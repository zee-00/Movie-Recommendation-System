A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences 
based on their similar choices and emotions. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user 
and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.
